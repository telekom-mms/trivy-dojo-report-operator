# trivy-dojo-report-operator

The trivy-dojo-report-operator is a Kubernetes operator developed using Kopf and
Python. This operator listens for vulnerability reports generated by the
[Trivy Operator](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator) and forwards them
to [Defect Dojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) for further
analysis and tracking.

## Features

* Monitor Kubernetes for new Trivy vulnerability reports.
* Push vulnerability reports to a configured Defect Dojo instance.
* Seamless integration with your existing Kubernetes cluster and security workflow.
* Developed using the Pythonic Kopf framework for easy maintenance and extensibility.

## Supported Reports

* Vulnerability reports
* RBAC Assessment reports
* Infra Assessment reports
* Config Audit reports
* Exposed secrets

## Prerequisites

* A running Kubernetes cluster (minikube, kind, or another environment)
* Trivy Operator installed and configured in the cluster
* An instance of Defect Dojo for storing vulnerability reports

## Installation and Usage

* Configure Defect Dojo settings:

Update the variables in the [values.yaml](charts/values.yaml) to match your
Defect Dojo instance configuration, including the environment variables.
The most important settings are the URL and the API-Key for your Defect Dojo
instance:

```yml
defectDojoApiCredentials:
  apiKey: "YOUR_DEFECTDOJO_API_KEY"
  url: "https://YOUR.DEFECTDOJO.URL"
```

The options closely match the options in the `import-scan` API-call found in the
[Defect Dojo API Docs](https://demo.defectdojo.org/api/v2/oa3/swagger-ui/).

* Deploy the chart from the repository:

```bash
helm repo add trivy-dojo-report-operator https://telekom-mms.github.io/trivy-dojo-report-operator/
helm repo update
helm install $YOUR_RELEASE_NAME trivy-dojo-report-operator/trivy-dojo-report-operator --values YOUR_VALUES.yaml
```

* or deploy the chart manually after cloning the git-repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/telekom-mms/trivy-dojo-report-operator.git
cd trivy-dojo-report-operator
helm install $YOUR_RELEASE_NAME charts/
```

* or deploy the trivy-dojo-report-operator using the Kubernetes manifests
  * update the secret in the [manifest](deploy/trivy-dojo-report-operator.yaml)
  * apply manifests

```bash
kubectl create ns mgmt
kubectl apply -f deploy/trivy-dojo-report-operator.yaml
```

The operator is now running in your cluster and will monitor for Trivy
vulnerability reports and push them to the configured Defect Dojo instance.

## Running locally with Docker

You can also run the operator locally. This way you don't have to install
anything in your cluster. Just provide the Defect Dojo URL and API-Key and
optionally labels to the `docker run` command.
You also have to mount your kubeconfig into the container to access the cluster.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/telekom-mms/docker-trivy-dojo-operator

docker run -it -v /path/to/your/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config \
  -e DEFECT_DOJO_API_KEY=$DEFECT_DOJO_API_KEY \
  -e DEFECT_DOJO_URL=$DEFECT_DOJO_URL \
  -e DEFECT_DOJO_PRODUCT_TYPE_NAME="Research and Development" \
  -e LABEL="trivy-operator.resource.name" \
  -e LABEL_VALUE="master-live-server" \
  -e REPORTS="vulnerabilityreports"
  ghcr.io/telekom-mms/docker-trivy-dojo-operator
```

### A note on eval

When setting one of the Eval*-settings to `true`, the corresponding name or
title will be run as a python function.

For example, set defectDojoEvalEngagementName to `true` and
`defectDojoEngagementName` to `meta["creationTimestamp"]`, then the
creationTimestamp of the vulnerability Report Resource in Kubernetes will be
evaluated and used as the engagement name.

If you set defectDojoEngagementName to `body["report"]["artifact"]["tag"]`,
then the engagement will get the name of the specified image-tag.

## Metrics

The operator provides a Prometheus metrics endpoint(:9090/metrics), where
successful and failed requests are collected.

```bash
# HELP request_processing_seconds Time spent processing request
# TYPE request_processing_seconds summary
request_processing_seconds_count 0.0
request_processing_seconds_sum 0.0
# HELP request_processing_seconds_created Time spent processing request
# TYPE request_processing_seconds_created gauge
request_processing_seconds_created 1.7507117204042602e+09
# HELP requests_total HTTP Requests
# TYPE requests_total counter
requests_total{status="failed"} 4.0
requests_total{status="success"} 1.0
# HELP requests_created HTTP Requests
# TYPE requests_created gauge
requests_created{status="failed"} 1.750711807587969e+09
requests_created{status="success"} 1.750712088603659e+09
```

## Creating new Releases

* On push to main
  * a new release version is calculated
  * versions in all files are automatically updated
  * k8s manifests are rendered from the helm chart and updated in deploy/
  * a draft release is created

* On publish of the release a
  * new tag is created
  * new release is created
  * new container image is built
  * new helm chart is published
